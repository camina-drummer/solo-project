Brief: 
● Identify your users ●
New or experienced tabletop RPG players who want an easy way to create the "flavor" for their character.

● Identify the problem you’re solving for them ●
When creating a tabletop RPG character, it's straightforward pick a race/class/spell or roll dice for character stats. But it's usually harder to create a character backstory or find an image that matches the character you picture in your head. My app will help players this "creative" side of character creation.

● What are your user stories ●

● What are your core features? (MVP scope) ●
- Taking user input to create a ChatGPT api call to get back a character backstory.
- Having a login for the user.
- Saving the API data to a SQL database so users can store multiple characters.

● What are technical challenges do you expect? ●
- Making the API call.
- Using PostgreSQL.
- Linking the frontend, backend, and database together.

● What are your stretch goals ●
Short-term
- Adding a Midjourney API call based on a prompt generated by ChatGPT. The ChatGPT prompt should be based on the backstory generated in the initial ChatGPT API call.
Mid-term
- Implementing Redux.
- Implementing stat generators.
Long-term
- Creating a formatted printable PDF from the character sheet generated.
